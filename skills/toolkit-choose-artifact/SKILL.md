# Choose the Right Artifact Type

**I'll help you decide whether to create a command, skill, agent, rule, or plan.**

This skill uses an interactive decision tree to understand your needs and recommend the right artifact type.

## Why This Matters

Each artifact type has different characteristics:
- **Context persistence** - How they behave in long conversations
- **Interaction model** - User-interactive vs LLM-direct
- **Tool availability** - What operations they can perform
- **Invocation timing** - Always loaded vs on-demand

Choosing the right type ensures your contribution works as intended.

## Quick Decision Matrix

| If you need... | Use this |
|----------------|----------|
| Execute bash operation immediately | **Command** |
| Guide user through multi-step workflow | **Skill** |
| Provide expert coaching/guidance | **Agent** |
| Define standard/convention | **Rule** |
| Document implementation approach | **Plan** |

## Interactive Decision Process

Let me ask you some questions to find the best fit:

### Question 1: What's the primary purpose?

**A. Execute an operation (bash script, automate task)**
→ Likely a **Command**
- Examples: Create files, run git operations, process data
- Go to Question 2 to confirm

**B. Guide user through interactive workflow**
→ Likely a **Skill**
- Examples: Setup wizard, decision helper, step-by-step process
- Go to Question 3 to confirm

**C. Provide expert knowledge/coaching**
→ Likely an **Agent**
- Examples: Architecture guidance, best practices, domain expertise
- Go to Question 4 to confirm

**D. Define standard, convention, or rule**
→ Definitely a **Rule**
- Examples: Naming conventions, frontmatter standards, when to use patterns
- ✅ Use **Rule** → See "Rules Deep Dive" below

**E. Document implementation plan**
→ Definitely a **Plan**
- Examples: Feature design, architecture decisions, implementation steps
- ✅ Use **Plan** → See "Plans Deep Dive" below

---

### Question 2: Command Confirmation

You said you want to **execute an operation**.

**Does it need user interaction during execution?**

**A. No - just run and show output**
→ ✅ Use **Command**
- Bash script executes, user sees results
- Examples: `/toolkit-new-handover`, `/toolkit-archive`, `/release`

**B. Yes - ask questions, get input, guide through steps**
→ ❌ Not a command → Use **Skill** instead
- Commands execute directly, skills guide interactively
- Example: Instead of command that asks questions, make skill that walks through workflow

**C. It needs to make complex decisions based on codebase state**
→ 🤔 Consider **Skill with agent** or **Agent**
- If mostly automation → Skill (can invoke agents)
- If mostly guidance → Agent

---

### Question 3: Skill Confirmation

You said you want to **guide user through interactive workflow**.

**Will this be invoked frequently in long-running conversations?**

**A. Yes - user might invoke multiple times in one session**
→ ✅ Definitely use **Skill**
- Progressive disclosure keeps context fresh
- Not subject to dilution
- Example: `/toolkit-handover` invoked whenever creating handover

**B. No - more of ongoing coaching throughout conversation**
→ 🤔 Consider **Agent** instead
- Agents provide continuous guidance
- Better for "always available" expertise
- But note: Subject to context dilution over time

**Does it need to execute operations or just guide?**

**A. Execute operations (create files, run commands)**
→ ✅ Use **Skill** (can include scripts as assets)
- Skills can bundle executable code
- Examples: `/toolkit-setup` creates directories

**B. Just guide with instructions**
→ ✅ Still use **Skill** if invoked on-demand
→ 🤔 Consider **Agent** if ongoing coaching

---

### Question 4: Agent Confirmation

You said you want to **provide expert knowledge/coaching**.

**When should this guidance be available?**

**A. Always throughout the conversation**
→ ✅ Use **Agent**
- Loaded at session start
- Provides ongoing expertise
- ⚠️ Warning: Context dilution - impact fades after hours of conversation

**B. Only when user explicitly asks for help**
→ 🤔 Consider **Skill** instead
- Invoked on-demand
- Fresh context each time
- No dilution problem
- Example: This very skill you're using!

**Does it need to execute operations?**

**A. Yes - write code, edit files**
→ ✅ Use **Agent with Skill delegation**
- **Best practice:** Agent is read-only, invokes write-capable Skills
- Follows Principle of Least Privilege
- Example: `toolkit-workflows` agent invokes `/toolkit-new-handover` skill
- Agent coordinates, Skill executes
- See `rules/toolkit-agents.md` for details

**B. No - just coaching/guidance**
→ ✅ Use **Agent** for ongoing coaching
→ 🤔 Use **Skill** for on-demand coaching (avoids dilution)

## Deep Dive: Each Artifact Type

### Commands

**What they are:**
- Bash scripts that execute operations
- Invoked via `/command-name`
- Execute immediately, show output

**Context behavior:**
- Not loaded at startup
- Invoked on-demand
- Fresh execution each time
- ✅ Not affected by context dilution

**Tool availability:**
- Bash execution
- Can run any shell command
- Full system access

**Interaction model:**
- Execute → Show output
- Not interactive (can't ask questions mid-execution)
- User sees results

**Best for:**
- ✅ Automation tasks
- ✅ File operations (create, move, archive)
- ✅ Git operations
- ✅ Quick utilities
- ✅ Data processing

**Examples:**
- `/toolkit-new-handover` - Create handover file
- `/toolkit-archive` - Archive old handovers
- `/release` - Create release

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Need user interaction during execution → Use Skill
- ❌ Need ongoing guidance → Use Agent
- ❌ Defining a standard → Use Rule

---

### Skills

**What they are:**
- Interactive workflows with progressive disclosure
- Invoked via `/skill-name`
- Guide user through multi-step processes
- Can bundle scripts, templates, assets

**Context behavior:**
- ✅ Progressive disclosure (name+description at startup, full content on invocation)
- ✅ Fresh context each invocation
- ✅ Not affected by dilution
- Perfect for long-running conversations

**Tool availability:**
- Full tool access
- Can read, write, execute
- Can bundle executable assets

**Interaction model:**
- Interactive Q&A
- Multi-step workflows
- Can execute bundled scripts
- User is actively engaged

**Best for:**
- ✅ Setup wizards
- ✅ Decision helpers (like this skill!)
- ✅ Multi-step processes
- ✅ Interactive configuration
- ✅ Guided workflows

**Examples:**
- `/toolkit-setup` - Initialize workspace
- `/toolkit-handover` - Create handover interactively
- `/toolkit-choose-artifact` - This skill!

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Simple bash execution → Use Command
- ❌ Ongoing passive guidance → Use Agent or Rule
- ❌ Just defining a standard → Use Rule

---

### Agents

**What they are:**
- Expert coaching and guidance
- Loaded based on agent description matching task
- Provide domain expertise
- LLM talks directly to them (not user-interactive)

**Context behavior:**
- ⚠️ Loaded at session start (or when task matches)
- ⚠️ Subject to context dilution over hours
- Impact fades in long conversations
- Better at session start than hours later

**Tool availability:**
- Can specify tool subset for agent
- **Best practice:** Read-only agents + Skill tool for delegation
- Agents invoke Skills when write operations needed
- Skills run with their own permissions (not limited by agent)
- Example: Read-only agent → invokes write-capable skill
- See `rules/toolkit-agents.md` for architecture details

**Interaction model:**
- LLM-direct (not user-interactive)
- Provides expertise and coaching
- Influences behavior and decisions
- Background guidance

**Best for:**
- ✅ Domain expertise (architecture, workflows)
- ✅ Coding standards coaching
- ✅ Best practices guidance
- ✅ Specialized knowledge areas
- ✅ Session-start guidance
- ✅ Coordinating workflows (read-only agent + Skill delegation)

**Examples:**
- `agents/toolkit-architecture` - System architecture reference (read-only; also diagnoses organization issues)
- `agents/toolkit-workflows` - Workflow coordinator (invokes skills)
- `agents/toolkit-team-workflows` - PR/release/versioning coordinator (invokes skills)

**See also:** `rules/toolkit-agents.md` for agent architecture standards

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Long-running conversations → Use Skill (no dilution)
- ❌ Need frequent re-invocation → Use Skill
- ❌ Execute operations → Use Command or Skill
- ❌ Define standards → Use Rule

**Context dilution workaround:**
- Make it a **Skill** instead if used frequently
- User can re-invoke to get fresh context
- Example: This artifact guide is a skill, not an agent!

---

### Rules

**What they are:**
- Standards, conventions, patterns
- **Modular alternative to monolithic CLAUDE.md files**
- Always loaded at session start
- Passive influence on behavior
- Quick reference guides

**Context behavior:**
- ⚠️ Loaded at startup
- ⚠️ Subject to context dilution
- Passive influence (not invoked)
- Better for quick reference than complex decisions

**Tool availability:**
- None - just guidance text
- No execution capability

**Interaction model:**
- Always present
- Passive influence
- No invocation needed
- LLM refers to them as needed

**Best for:**
- ✅ Naming conventions
- ✅ Frontmatter standards
- ✅ Code style guidelines
- ✅ When to use patterns
- ✅ Quick reference material
- ✅ Breaking up large CLAUDE.md files into focused, modular pieces

**Examples:**
- `rules/toolkit-naming-conventions.md`
- `rules/toolkit-frontmatter-standards.md`
- `rules/toolkit-session-continuity.md`

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Complex decision trees → Use Skill
- ❌ Execute operations → Use Command
- ❌ Deep coaching → Use Agent
- ❌ Implementation details → Use Plan

---

### Plans

**What they are:**
- Implementation plans and architecture decisions
- Documentation of approach
- Not executable - informational

**Context behavior:**
- Read when needed
- Not loaded automatically
- User or LLM references them

**Tool availability:**
- None - just documentation

**Interaction model:**
- Reference material
- Not invoked
- Describes what to build, not how to build it

**Best for:**
- ✅ Architecture decisions
- ✅ Feature implementation plans
- ✅ Technical design documents
- ✅ Approach documentation

**Examples:**
- `plans/auth-implementation.md`
- `plans/api-redesign.md`
- `plans/2026-02-02-exploring-options.md` (working plan)

**When NOT to use:**
- ❌ Executable operations → Use Command or Skill
- ❌ Standards → Use Rule
- ❌ Ongoing guidance → Use Agent

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Command that asks user questions

**Problem:** Commands execute immediately, not interactive

**Solution:** Make it a Skill instead
- Skills can ask questions
- Guide through workflow

---

### ❌ Agent for frequently-invoked guidance

**Problem:** Context dilution in long conversations

**Solution:** Make it a Skill
- Progressive disclosure
- Fresh context each invocation
- Example: This artifact guide is a skill!

---

### ❌ Skill for passive reference material

**Problem:** Skills are for active invocation

**Solution:** Make it a Rule instead
- Always loaded
- Quick reference
- No invocation needed

---

### ❌ Rule with complex decision trees

**Problem:** Rules are passive, dilute over time

**Solution:** Make it a Skill
- Interactive decision making
- Fresh context when needed
- Active guidance

---

### ❌ Plan with executable code

**Problem:** Plans are documentation, not execution

**Solution:**
- Plan describes the approach
- Command/Skill implements it

---

## Experimenting Safely: The *.local.* Pattern

**When creating new artifacts, start with local experiments:**

### The Pattern

**Local experiments (git-ignored):**
- Commands: `my-command.local.md`
- Skills: `my-skill.local/SKILL.md`
- Agents: `my-agent.local.md`
- Rules: `my-rule.local.md`
- Plans: `my-plan.local.md`

**Git pattern:** `*.local.*` matches all of these

### The Workflow

1. **Create local:**
   ```
   .claude/plans/auth-helper.local.md
   ```

2. **Test thoroughly** without worrying about git

3. **Promote when ready:**
   ```
   /toolkit-promote plans/auth-helper.local.md
   ```

4. **Result:**
   ```
   .claude/commands/toolkit-auth-helper.md
   ```

5. **Open PR** to share with team

### Why This Works

- ✅ **Safe** - *.local.* files are git-ignored
- ✅ **Frictionless** - No git worries during experimentation
- ✅ **Clear path** - Experiment → Test → Promote → Team
- ✅ **Reversible** - Easy to delete failed experiments

### Location Matters

**In .claude/plans/:**
- Start experiments here
- Test locally
- Promote to appropriate artifact directory

**After promotion:**
- Moves to `.claude/commands/toolkit-<name>.md` (for commands)
- Or `.claude/skills/toolkit-<name>/` (for skills - directory)
- Or `.claude/agents/toolkit-<name>.md` (for agents)
- Or `.claude/rules/toolkit-<name>.md` (for rules)

**Sessions never get promoted:**
- Sessions are short-term (days)
- Plans are long-term (weeks of testing)
- Only plans get promoted to team level

---

## The Meta-Example

**Notice what this artifact guide is:**

✅ **A Skill** - Not an agent, not a rule!

**Why?**
- 📋 Invoked on-demand (`/toolkit-choose-artifact`)
- 🔄 Progressive disclosure (name+description at startup, full content now)
- 🎯 Interactive decision tree
- ✨ Fresh context each invocation
- ⏱️ Not subject to dilution (you can invoke multiple times)

**Why NOT an agent?**
- ❌ Would dilute over long conversations
- ❌ Not needed as ongoing background guidance
- ❌ Better invoked when actually needed

**Why NOT a rule?**
- ❌ Too complex for passive reference
- ❌ Interactive Q&A doesn't fit rule model
- ❌ Decision tree needs active guidance

**Why NOT a command?**
- ❌ Not executing an operation
- ❌ Needs interaction, not just output
- ❌ Guiding decisions, not automating tasks

**This skill demonstrates the very pattern it teaches!**
