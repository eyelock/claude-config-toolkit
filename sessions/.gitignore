# Session Handover Documents
#
# Purpose: Bridge the gap between AI conversation sessions
# Pattern: YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
#
# These files are git-ignored because they're your personal session state.
# Think of them as "save points" in your collaboration with Claude.
#
# When to create:
# - Pausing work mid-stream
# - Switching contexts
# - Need to resume later (possibly different Claude instance)
# - Complex multi-session work
#
# Structure all files by default
*

# But track structure documentation
