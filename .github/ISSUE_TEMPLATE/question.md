## Question

What do you need help with?

## Context

What are you trying to accomplish? What have you tried so far?

## Environment

- LLM Tool: [Claude Code / Cursor / Other]
- Config version: v___
- OS: ___

## Why an Issue Instead of Discussion?

**Note:** Most questions are better suited for [Discussions](../discussions/new?category=questions) where the community can help!

Issues are for questions that need:
- [ ] Tracking in the backlog
- [ ] Documentation to be updated as a result
- [ ] Code changes to clarify behavior
- [ ] Investigation of unclear/undocumented behavior

If your question doesn't need tracking, please post in [Discussions → Questions](../discussions/new?category=questions) instead!

**Consider Discussions if you're asking:**
- "How do I...?"
- "What's the best way to...?"
- "Can someone help me understand...?"
- "Is it possible to...?"

**Use Issues if you're reporting:**
- "The documentation says X but it does Y"
- "This behavior is unclear and needs documenting"
- "I need an answer tracked for future reference"
